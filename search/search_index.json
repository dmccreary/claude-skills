Task-Based (best for tool collections)         23 -  - Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities         24 -  - Example: PDF skill with \"Quick Start\" \u2192 \"Merge PDFs\" \u2192 \"Split PDFs\" \u2192 \"Extract Text\"         25 -  - Structure: ## Overview \u2192 ## Quick Start \u2192 ## Task Category 1 \u2192 ## Task Category 2...         22 +  ### Step 1: Analyze the Course Description         23           24 -  3. Reference/Guidelines (best for standards or specifications)         25 -  - Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements         26 -  - Example: Brand styling with \"Brand Guidelines\" \u2192 \"Colors\" \u2192 \"Typography\" \u2192 \"Features\"         27 -  - Structure: ## Overview \u2192 ## Guidelines \u2192 ## Specifications \u2192 ## Usage...         24 +  Read the <code>/docs/course-description.md</code> file to determine:         25 +  - Grade level or target audience (junior-high, senior-high, college, graduate)         26 +  - Prerequisites - indicates reader sophistication         27 +  - Subject matter - determines reference topics         28 +  - Learning objectives - guides reference selection         29           30 -  4. Capabilities-Based (best for integrated systems)         31 -  - Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features         32 -  - Example: Product Management with \"Core Capabilities\" \u2192 numbered capability list         33 -  - Structure: ## Overview \u2192 ## Core Capabilities \u2192 ### 1. Feature \u2192 ### 2. Feature...         30 +  The grade level determines:         31 +  - Junior-high (middle school): 10 references - fun, engaging, visual resources         32 +  - Senior-high (high school): 20 references - mix of accessible and academic sources         33 +  - College (undergraduate): 30 references - more academic, some peer-reviewed papers         34 +  - Graduate (masters/PhD): 40 references - heavily peer-reviewed, authoritative sources         35           36 -  Patterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex            -  operations).         36 +  ### Step 2: Check for Chapter-Level Content         37           38 -  Delete this entire \"Structuring This Skill\" section when done - it's just guidance.]         38 +  Before generating references, search for chapter content in the textbook:         39           40 -  ## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]         40 +  <code>bash         41 +  # Look for chapter files         42 +  find /docs -name \"chapter*.md\" -o -name \"*-chapter-*.md\"         43 +</code>         44           45 -  [TODO: Add content here.
