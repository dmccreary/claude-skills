Sacred sites included stone circles, groves, and wells. Religious practices involved seasonal festivals (Samhain, Beltane, Lughnasadh, Imbolc) that later influenced Christian holy days. This polytheistic worldview emphasized connection to the land and cycles of nature, quite different from the monotheistic Christianity that would arrive later."

Patrick established churches, monasteries, and schools throughout Ireland. Irish Christianity developed distinctive features, including a strong monastic tradition and emphasis on missionary work. Unlike much of Europe where Christianity spread through Roman imperial power, Ireland adopted Christianity peacefully through persuasion. Irish monks would later play a crucial role in spreading Christianity back to parts of Europe during the early medieval period."

This migration was pivotal: it introduced Christianity to the Picts in Scotland and established Gaelic as a major language. The term 'Scotland' itself derives from these Irish settlers, the 'Scoti.'"

Iona became a major center of learning, art (including the famous Book of Kells), and missionary activity. The Celtic Christian tradition established by Columba emphasized monasticism, scholarship, and missionary work—traditions that would influence Scottish religious culture for centuries, even after the later adoption of Roman Catholic practices and eventually Protestantism."

This marked the beginning of closer ties between Scotland/Ireland and the broader Catholic Church centered in Rome, though distinctive regional practices persisted.
