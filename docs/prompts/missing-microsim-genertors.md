# Missing MicroSim Generators

!!! prompt
    We are creating intelligent textbooks that need diagrams, figures, charts, graphs, timelines, maps and Micro Simulators (MicroSims).
    We now have the following MicroSims generator Skills:

1. bubble-chart-generator - Creates interactive bubble charts for priority matrices (Impact vs Effort, Risk vs Value)
and multi-dimensional data visualization using Chart.js
2. chartjs-generator - Creates any of the charts supported by the ChartJS library suitable for inclusion in an iframe
3. map-generator - Creates interactive geographic maps with markers, layers, and GeoJSON support using Leaflet.js,
optimized for iframe embedding in narrow textbook pages
4. mermaid-generator - Creates flowcharts, process diagrams, and decision trees with colorful backgrounds and 16-point
fonts using Mermaid.js
5. microsim-p5 - Creates interactive educational simulations with two-region layouts (drawing area + controls) using
p5.js, designed for browser-based learning
6. timeline-generator - Creates interactive chronological visualizations with zoom, pan, and category filtering using
vis-timeline.js for historical events and project schedules
7. venn-diagram-generator - Creates Venn diagrams with educational tooltips (definitions from glossary, not size values)
using venn.js for visualizing set relationships and overlaps
8. vis-network - Creates interactive network graphs for learning graphs, concept dependencies, and relationship
visualization using vis-network.js with physics-based layouts

These are general MicroSim generators that might be used to generate in many types of textbooks.
This list does NOT include highly specialized MicroSims such as generating Circuit Diagrams in a Electrical Engineering course.
Can you think of any other general purpose types of diagrams or simulations that might be requested by a textbook creator?
