# MicroSim Matcher Skill

I have a problem and I want your suggestions on how to create a new skill that will do the following:

1. The input to the skill will be a single specification file of a diagram, infographic or microsim
2. I want you to analyze the file and then create a ranking of the quality of matches between the specification and the capabilities of a microsim-generator skill.
3.  List of the microsims and their capabilties is located at @docs/skill-descriptions/microsims/index.md
