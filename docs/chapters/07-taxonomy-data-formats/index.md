# Taxonomy and Data Formats

## Summary

This chapter explores how to add taxonomy information to your learning graph and convert it to various formats for visualization and processing. You'll learn about the TaxonomyID field in CSV files and the process of adding taxonomy categorization to existing concept graphs. The chapter provides comprehensive coverage of the vis-network JSON format, including its schema structure with metadata, groups, nodes, and edges sections.

You'll learn about Dublin Core metadata standards and how to properly populate metadata fields including title, description, creator, date, version, format, and license. The chapter also covers color coding strategies for visualizations and font color selection for readability. Finally, you'll be introduced to Python scripting for learning graph processing, including key scripts like analyze-graph.py and csv-to-json.py.
