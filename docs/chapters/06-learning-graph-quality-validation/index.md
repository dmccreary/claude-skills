# Learning Graph Quality and Validation

## Summary

This chapter focuses on validating and assessing the quality of your learning graph. You'll learn techniques for detecting circular dependencies and validating that your graph is a proper Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The chapter covers self-dependency checking and introduces comprehensive quality metrics including orphaned nodes, disconnected subgraphs, and linear chain detection.

You'll learn to analyze your graph using indegree and outdegree metrics, calculate average dependencies per concept, and determine the maximum dependency chain length. The chapter culminates with learning how to generate an overall learning graph quality score. Additionally, you'll explore taxonomy distribution metrics to ensure balanced category representation and avoid over-representation of any single topic area.
