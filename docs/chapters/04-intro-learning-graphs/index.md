# Introduction to Learning Graphs

## Summary

This chapter introduces learning graphs, a powerful tool for mapping the knowledge structure of your course. You'll learn about concept nodes, dependency edges, and how they form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents prerequisite relationships. The chapter explains how concept dependencies create learning pathways that guide students through material in an optimal sequence.

You'll also learn practical strategies for optimizing your Claude usage, understanding 4-hour usage windows and Claude Pro limitations, which will help you work efficiently as you generate learning graphs and other content in later chapters.
