# Concept Enumeration and Dependencies

## Summary

This chapter teaches you how to enumerate concepts for your learning graph and map their dependencies. You'll learn the process of generating approximately 200 concepts from a course description, following specific requirements for concept labels including Title Case convention and maximum character length. The chapter emphasizes the importance of concept granularity and creating atomic concepts that represent single, clear ideas.

You'll also learn about the CSV file format used for learning graphs, including pipe-delimited dependencies and the structure of ConceptID, ConceptLabel, and Dependencies fields. The chapter introduces taxonomy categorization and distinguishes between foundational, prerequisite, and advanced concepts in your knowledge graph.
