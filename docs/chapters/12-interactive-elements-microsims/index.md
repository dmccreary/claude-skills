# Interactive Elements and MicroSims

## Summary

This chapter introduces MicroSims, interactive educational simulations built with the p5.js JavaScript library that bring concepts to life through visualization and interactivity. You'll learn about the MicroSim directory structure, including main.html files for simulations and index.md files for documentation. The chapter covers iframe embedding techniques for integrating simulations into your textbook pages.

You'll explore key simulation design principles including seeded randomness for reproducibility, and learn to create interactive controls using sliders and buttons that allow students to experiment with parameters. The chapter also covers MicroSim metadata and broader principles of educational simulation design that ensure your interactive elements effectively support learning objectives.
